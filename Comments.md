## Is there anything else you would like us to know?

Indefatigability, to not give up, is what I value the most. Under any circumstance, I will try again and again to achieve what I think is the right thing to do. I am not applying to WWDC Scholarship for some self-satisfaction.  This scholarship is one of my next steps toward my dream, which is to make the world a better place.  I am stepping toward my dream one at a time, indefatigably. I see WWDC as an event where I will see more, learn more, and think more. Attending the WWDC will be another big step to materializing my dream, and I believe the experience will be a solid cornerstone for the next phase in my dream.
