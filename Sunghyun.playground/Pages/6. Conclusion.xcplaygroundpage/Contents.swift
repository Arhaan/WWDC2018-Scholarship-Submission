 ## Conclusion
 ### Basel Problem > Leibniz Formula > Monte Carlo Method
 - Note: ***Congratulations***! You have finished visually experiencing three ways to calculate π.
 - Important: The Basel Problem (*Taylor Series*) is the most reliable and accurate way to calculate π. Monte Carlo Method, on the other hand, relied on random number generation, therefore being the most unreliable and inaccurate way.
